# Data Analysis Script Setup

To run the script to find images for the spaciously events, you should first set up a Python virtual environment. This ensures that you have the correct versions of the required libraries. Follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment in your directory:

```
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS and Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script with Python:

```
python find_spaciously_images.py
```

Deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:

```
deactivate
```
